# Instruction to clone in github
In the directory that you want to host your local repository of our project, run:

git clone git@github.com:INFT2060/model

After finish cloning, cd into the repository and you will have access to your local repository. It should have a branch named "main" already in that. To practice coding with caution, I recommend you guys to do these in order every time you starting to work on this project):

1. Run this to update your main branch to ensure getting the most up-to-date version to work with:

git pull origin main

2. Run this to create an alternative branch to work with in your personal laptop to not create any conflict with other people's laptop (replace <branch-name> with your desired name):

git checkout -b <branch-name>

3. Run this to push your branch to our remote repository and wait for group members to verify before merging into our main branch (do not push your main branch):

git push origin <branch-name>

4. Run this to delete your alternative branch after merging that branch into main branch on remote repo:

git branch -d <branch-name>
